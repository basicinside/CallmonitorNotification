---- CallmonitorNotification ----
written by Robin Kuck < robin @ basicinside.de >

Just a quick hack to send notifications, when incoming calls arrive on the fritz box

	* display incoming calls
	* resolve callers name through the file "phonebook" (automatically created, when first call arrives)
	* try reconnect, if host isn't reachable

--- Requirements ---
	* ruby
	* notify-send
	* fritz!box fon device
	* optional pidgin (for the pixmap in the notification)

--- Install ---
Run "sh install.sh"


--- fritz!box ---
activate callmonitor
	call #96*5*

deactivate callmonitor
	call #96*4*
