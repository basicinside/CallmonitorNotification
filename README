---- CallmonitorNotification ----
written by Robin Kuck < robin @ basicinside.de >

Just a quick hack to send notifications, when incoming calls arrive on the fritz box

	* display incoming calls
	* resolve callers name through the file "phonebook" (automatically created, when first call arrives)
	* try reconnect, if host isn't reachable
	* autostart after login
	* gui-dummy

--- Requirements ---
	* ruby
	* notify-send
	* fritz!box fon device

--- Install ---
Run "sh install.sh"


--- fritz!box ---
activate callmonitor
	call #96*5*

deactivate callmonitor
	call #96*4*

--- the phone icon ---
the phone icons is pixmap (+ a modified version) from pidgin originally located at
/usr/share/pixmaps/pidgin/emotes/default/phone.png
