---- CallmonitorNotification ----
written by Robin Kuck < robin @ basicinside.de >

Just a quick hack to send notifications, when incoming calls arrive on the fritz box

	* resolve callers name through the file "phonebook" (automatically created, when first call arrives)


--- Requirements ---
	* libnotify-send
	* fritz.box-Callmonitor on Port 1012
	* ruby

--- Start ---
Run the following:
	chmod +x call.rb
	./call.rb


---TODO---
(no order)
	* Code cleanup & structure
	* config file
	* clone repo & develop a gnome tray
	* be quiet, when network does not know the fritz.box hostname
